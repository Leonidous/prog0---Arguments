# prog0---Arguments
A C++ program that loops through all of the command line arguments that are passed to
the program. For each argument, the program examines and then discards its first character. That character will tell the program what to do.

-If the first character is the letter S, then skip the argument and print nothing for that argument.

-If the first character is the letter L then convert every upper case letter in the argument to lower
case, and print the resulting argument on a line by itself. If a character is not an upper case
letter, then it should be unchanged.

-If the first character is the letter U then convert every lower case letter in the argument to upper
case, and print the resulting argument on a line by itself. If a character is not a lower case letter,
then it should be unchanged.

-If the first character is the letter r (lowercase r), print the letters in reverse order.

-If the first character is the letter R, print the letters in reverse order while ALSO converting any
lower case letters to upper case.
